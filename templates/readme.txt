== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I change the time that emails go out? =
The free plugin sends campaigns thirty minutes after carts become abandoned. If you want more control over the emails, then checkout the [Pro version](https://wp-cart-recovery.com/downloads/cart-recovery-for-wordpress-pro) which lets you set up multiple emails - as well as choose when those campaigns get sent.

= I can't activate the plugin? =
The plugin requires PHP 5.5 or above. In order to avoid problems, the plugin will refuse to activate on lower versions.

= Can I see the details of abandoned carts? =
The details of abandoned carts aren't available in the free version of the plugin. The [Pro version](https://wp-cart-recovery.com/downloads/cart-recovery-for-wordpress-pro) gives you a simple table of all abandoned carts, including the details of each cart if you want to follow up with customers manually.
